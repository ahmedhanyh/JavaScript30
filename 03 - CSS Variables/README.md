HTML
  - input element of type 'range'. It has attributes like min to set the start of the range
  and max to set the end of the range.
  Also the attribute 'value' sets the initial value for the range.
  - input element of type 'color' that allows the user to input a specific color.
  The initial color value is set with the value attribute.

CSS
  - We have to declare css variables inside some element like :root.
  - :root is very similar to the html element.
  - CSS variables are declared like so: --variableName: value; and to assign it as a 
  value to a property, we use var(--variableName) as the value for that property.
  - filter property: a property that applies graphical effects (like blur, contrast)
  on an element.

JS
  - mousemove event.
  - .dataset property is an object that contains all the data attributes the element has.
  - input event.
