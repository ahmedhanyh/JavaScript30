HTML
  - data attributes: they are attributes that we create, they're not part of HTML.
  data attributes are created by prefixing the name with 'data-'.
  - audio element: we can include/embed audio files into HTML documents using the audio element.

CSS
  - text-shadow property.
  - text-transform property.

JS
  - We can play embedded audio in an HTML doc by selecting the audio element and
  calling the method .play() on that element.
  - Also we can set the .currentTime property for an audio element to change the time
  at which the audio is playing (so if we set it to 0, it will start at the beginning).
  - transitionend event.
  - When a key is pressed down it fires the keydown event, which has some info about the key
  that's pressed like its associated symbol or its keyCode.
